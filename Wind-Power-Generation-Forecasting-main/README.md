An interactive, real-time weather dashboard built purely in Python. Select a location by searching for a city or clicking directly on an interactive map. This app is powered by Streamlit, Folium, and the **100% free, no-API-key-required** Open-Meteo API.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-Time Weather:** Get current temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions.
* **5-Day Forecast:** View a 5-day weather forecast with max/min temperatures and daily conditions.

## 🌱 Project Evolution

This project began as a Jupyter Notebook (`Wind_Power_Generation_Forecasting.ipynb`) for analyzing and forecasting wind power generation using machine learning (Random Forest, Linear Regression).

It has since evolved into a fully-interactive, front-end web application focused on providing real-time, user-friendly weather data for any location in the world.
